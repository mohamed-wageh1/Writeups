# Security Writeups 🧠💻

This repository contains selected security writeups documenting my hands-on practice across platforms such as **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, **OverTheWire**, and **PortSwigger**.

The focus of these writeups is not just solving challenges, but clearly explaining the **methodology, tools, and reasoning** behind each step.

## What you'll find here
- Enumeration and reconnaissance techniques
- Linux fundamentals and command-line workflows
- Web application vulnerabilities and exploitation
- Privilege escalation and post-exploitation
- Notes and takeaways from each challenge

> Note: This repository is continuously updated as part of my ongoing learning journey in cybersecurity.
